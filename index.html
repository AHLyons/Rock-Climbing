    <p class="space">Rock climbing is a recreational and sport activity that involves ascending rock formations using
      physical
      strength, technique, and gear. The origins of rock climbing can be traced back to various cultures and regions
      throughout history. </p>

      <div class="text-wrapper">

        <h2>Where did it start?</h2>
        <p>Early forms of rock climbing can be seen in ancient civilizations such as China, where rock climbing was used
          for military purposes as early as the 3rd century BCE. There are also records of rock climbing activities in
          various parts of Europe dating back to the 16th century, where it was primarily used for hunting, exploration,
          and as a means of transportation.</p>

        <p>The development of modern rock climbing as a sport, however, can be attributed to the 19th century in Europe,
          particularly in the Alps. With the rise of mountaineering as a popular activity, climbers began to develop new
          techniques and equipment to ascend challenging rock faces in addition to mountains. Climbers like Walter Parry
          Haskett Smith, Geoffrey Winthrop Young, and Oscar Eckenstein are considered pioneers in the history of rock
          climbing, as they developed innovative methods and equipment, such as the use of ropes, pitons, and other
          protective devices.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="text-wrapper left">

        <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, rock climbing also gained popularity in North America,
          particularly
          in areas such as the Yosemite Valley in California. Climbers like John Muir, Royal Robbins, and Warren
          Harding
          pushed the boundaries of the sport by tackling increasingly difficult routes and developing new climbing
          techniques.</p>

        <p>Rock climbing continued to evolve as a sport throughout the 20th century, with the advent of more advanced
          gear,
          improved safety standards, and the establishment of climbing communities and organizations. Today, rock
          climbing
          is a popular outdoor activity, as well as a competitive sport with various disciplines, such as bouldering,
          sport climbing, and traditional (trad) climbing. It has also gained recognition as an Olympic sport, with
          sport
          climbing making its debut at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.</p>

        <h2>Should I start rock climbing?</h2>
        <p>Whether or not you should start rock climbing depends on your interests, fitness level, and personal goals.
          Rock
          climbing can be a rewarding and challenging activity that offers physical, mental, and emotional benefits.
          It
          provides a unique blend of physical exercise, problem-solving skills, and exposure to the great outdoors. If
          you
          enjoy being in nature, are looking for a full-body workout that engages both your muscles and your mind, and
          are
          interested in learning new skills and techniques, rock climbing can be a great option for you. However, it's
          important to note that rock climbing can also be physically demanding and requires proper training,
          equipment,
          and safety precautions. It's essential to start with professional instruction and progress at your own pace
          to
          ensure safety and build the necessary skills. Ultimately, whether you should start rock climbing depends on
          your
          own interests, commitment to safety, and willingness to learn and challenge yourself in a dynamic and
          exhilarating sport. But if you're up for an adventure, do it!!</p>

    <p>
      For all of these kinds of climbing, you'll want a good pair of shoes and chalk (normally carried in a chalk bag).
      You don't need a harness for bouldering, but you'll <strong>probably</strong> want one for the other kinds of
      climbing. <em>Well, at least if you don't like injuries or death.</em>
