  <h1>Top Rope</h1>


  <p>Top rope climbing is a style of rock climbing where the rope runs through an anchor at the top of the climb,
    and is attached to the climber's harness via a belay device held by a partner on the ground. In top rope
    climbing, the rope is already in place, so the climber does not need to place protection or worry about falling
    as much as they would in lead climbing.</p>

  <p>Here are the basic steps for top rope climbing:</p>

  <p>1. Tie a knot in one end of the rope and attach it to your harness using a locking carabiner.</p>
  <p>2. The other end of the rope should already be threaded through an anchor at the top of the climb.</p>
  <p>3. A belayer on the ground should take in slack rope through a belay device and keep the rope taut as the
    climber ascends.</p>
  <p>4. Climb up the route, using the rope as a safety measure to catch you if you fall.</p>
  <p>5. Once you reach the top of the climb, you can either set up an anchor and rappel back down, or you can be
    lowered back down to the ground by the belayer.</p>

  <p>Top rope climbing can be a good introduction to climbing for beginners as it allows them to focus on their
    technique and movement without worrying as much about falling or placing protection. However, it's still
    important to learn proper safety procedures and techniques from a qualified instructor to avoid accidents.</p>
