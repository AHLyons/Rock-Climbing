  <h1>Lead Climbing</h1>
  <p>Lead climbing is a style of rock climbing where the climber ascends a route while simultaneously placing
    protection (such as bolts, cams, or nuts) to protect against a fall. In lead climbing, the rope is not already
    fixed to the anchor at the top of the climb, as it is in top rope climbing. Instead, the lead climber carries
    the rope with them as they climb, clipping it into pre-placed protection as they go.</p>

  <p>Here are the basic steps for lead climbing:</p>

  <p>1. Tie a knot in one end of the rope and attach it to your harness using a locking carabiner.</p>
  <p>2. Climb up the route while placing protection as you go. Place protection in solid rock or other stable
    features such as cracks, pockets, or holes.</p>
  <p>3. Clip the rope into each piece of protection as you go, using quickdraws to extend the rope away from the
    rock
    to reduce rope drag.</p>
  <p>4. If you fall, the rope will catch you at the last point of protection you clipped into. You will then need to
    climb back up to where you fell from and continue climbing.</p>
  <p>5. Once you reach the top of the climb, you can either set up an anchor and bring up a second climber, or you
    can rappel back down to the ground.</p>

  <p>Lead climbing can be more challenging than top rope climbing as it requires a higher level of skill and
    experience to safely place protection and climb without falling. It's important to learn from a qualified
    instructor and practice on easier climbs before attempting more difficult routes.</p>
